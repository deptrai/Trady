# Future Ecosystem Integrations

Chain Lens is already working on several additional integrations to expand utility:
- Switchboard or Pyth Oracles → for real-time price alerts in chat
- Tensor Protocol → to explore NFT floor-based copy signals
- Marinade / Jito → for copy trading wallets that are LPing or staking
- Solana Name Service → show .sol usernames in chat and copy panel
- DeBridge / Wormhole → explore future cross-chain copy trading modules

These will unlock more use cases and make Chain Lens the central hub for both on-chain and social activity across Solana and beyond.
