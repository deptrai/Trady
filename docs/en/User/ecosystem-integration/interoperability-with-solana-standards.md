# Interoperability with Solana Standards

All of Chain Lens's actions are visible and trackable via:
- Solana RPC nodes
- Solscan / SolanaFM / Xray
- Jupiter explorer for swap paths
- Public wallet activity dashboards

This transparency reinforces Chain Lens's ethos:
Everything you do is yours — and you can verify it anywhere.
There are no hidden APIs, no off-chain tricks, and no shadow executions.
Every click is a signature. Every swap is yours.

### Summary

Chain Lens thrives not because it replaces Solana infrastructure — but because it extends and enhances it.

By building on top of the best tools in the ecosystem, Chain Lens:
- Saves users time
- Reduces complexity
- Adds a powerful layer of social and automation logic
- Keeps everything portable, trackable, and DeFi-native

Whether you're swapping tokens, copying wallets, or chatting about the next breakout — it's all happening within the Solana stack.

Chain Lens doesn't break the rules of DeFi. It just makes them easier to play with.
