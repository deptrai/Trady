# Backend Infrastructure & Performance

Chain Lens is optimized for speed and scalability, using:
- Stateless frontend with dynamic rendering
- Public RPC endpoints with fallback redundancy
- Client-side caching for wallets and swaps
- Event listeners that hook into wallet trade activity for CopySwap

All sensitive actions — wallet creation, signing, exporting — happen entirely in-browser, ensuring privacy and security by design.

Load tests show Chain Lens scales easily across thousands of concurrent users, with average swap execution time remaining under 2.2 seconds in real usage.
