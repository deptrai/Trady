# Introduction

Chain Lens is not a standalone application floating in a vacuum â€” it is deeply integrated into the Solana ecosystem and leverages the most powerful infrastructure and protocols available.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, Chain Lens plugs directly into:
- Aggregation systems
- Wallet SDKs
- Public RPCs
- On-chain data indexers
- Chat and identity services

This tight integration ensures performance, scalability, and access to the most liquid and active parts of the Solana blockchain.
