# Cross-Platform Compatibility

Chain Lens-generated wallets are Phantom-compatible and can be used on any Solana dApp or explorer. This means:
- A user can export their Chain Lens wallet and load it into Phantom or Solflare
- Wallets created elsewhere (via seed phrase) can be imported into Chain Lens manually (feature coming soon)
- Copy trading and swap transactions are visible on Solana explorers like Solscan and SolanaFM

Nothing Chain Lens does is proprietary â€” everything is standard, transparent, and interoperable.
