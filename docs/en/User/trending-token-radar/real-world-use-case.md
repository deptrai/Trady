# Real-World Use Case

Imagine this:

You're browsing the Trending Radar and see a token that jumped from 60 to 92 in score within 10 minutes.

You click it — and notice that two wallets on the Copy leaderboard just entered.

In the chat, users are excited. Whale alerts are being posted.

You click "Snipe Now" and enter the token before it hits X or gets listed on pump.fun.

That's the Radar in action — not just showing what's up, but surfacing tradeable conviction signals at exactly the right moment.
