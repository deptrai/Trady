# Overview

The crypto world moves fast — especially on Solana. Tokens can 2x or rug within minutes, and unless you're watching every Telegram, Twitter feed, and wallet tracker at once, you'll likely miss the action.

That's why Chain Lens includes a built-in Trending Token Radar — a real-time engine that detects momentum shifts in tokens across the Solana ecosystem and surfaces them to users before it's too late.

Unlike simple "top gainer" lists, Chain Lens's radar combines on-chain metrics and off-chain social signals into a single dynamic system designed to help users find:
- What's pumping
- What's about to pump
- What whales are entering
- What tokens are getting talked about — and traded

The goal? Help you react like a pro, without needing a dozen external tools.
