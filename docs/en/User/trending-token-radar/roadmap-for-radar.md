# Roadmap for Radar

Planned upgrades include:
- 🧠 AI-trained alert thresholds (self-adjusting based on market conditions)
- 🗺️ Heatmaps for sector-based token trends (e.g. memes, infra, NFTs)
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Group sentiment scoring from chat analysis
- 🧪 Community-based tagging (users flagging early plays)

These improvements will transform Radar into one of the most intelligent trend discovery systems in Web3.

### Summary

The Trending Token Radar is your window into real-time alpha.

It doesn't just show what's moving — it shows why, and how. With seamless integration into CopySwap, chat, and whale detection, Chain Lens becomes a launchpad not just for reaction, but strategic action.
