# Accuracy & Limitations

No system is perfect. Radar uses a data-driven approach, not hype or influencer names. That means:
- Tokens may spike in social score but not price
- False positives can happen if bot wallets flood the network
- Low liquidity tokens may trigger alerts based on volume % alone

However, these limitations are addressed by adding:
- Liquidity filters
- Whale filters
- Anti-bot wallet exclusion (flagged wallets don't count)

Over time, as more users interact and copy trade, the Radar becomes smarter and more adaptive.
