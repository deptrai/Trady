# Integration with CopySwap

One of the most powerful features of the Radar is how it integrates with CopySwap.

If a wallet you're copying starts trading a token that is also trending, Chain Lens will show you:
- The token's Radar score
- Who else is entering
- Swap performance over the past hour
- Copy volume metrics (how many users just mirrored this trade)

This creates a double confidence layer â€” you're not only following a smart wallet, you're seeing the token gain public traction at the same time.
