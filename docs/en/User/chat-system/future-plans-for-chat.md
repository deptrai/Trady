# Future Plans for Chat

Chain Lens's chat system will evolve over time to support:
- ✅ Wallet-based leaderboards (most upvoted messages per token)
- ✅ Public profiles with verified badges
- ✅ Chat-based Copy Calls — follow a wallet directly from their chat message
- ✅ Token-level sentiment graphs (chat mood analytics)
- ✅ Private whisper DMs (with wallet-to-wallet encryption)
- ✅ Cross-token chat tabs (chat across your watchlist)

These features will help make Chain Lens not just a place to trade — but a place to stay.

### Summary

Chain Lens's chat system is not a side feature — it's the soul of the platform.

It bridges the gap between data and instinct, automation and emotion.

By embedding real-time discussion, alerting, moderation, and identity into every token — Chain Lens turns trading into a shared experience.

Don't trade alone. Trade together, live, and smarter.
