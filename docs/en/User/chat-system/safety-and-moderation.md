# Safety and Moderation

Chain Lens includes several safety layers to ensure chat doesn't turn into noise or scams.

#### ✅ Rate Limiting
Users can only send X messages per minute.
Wallets spamming are auto-muted.

#### ✅ Link Protection
Messages with links are hidden unless from a trusted wallet or admin.

#### ✅ Keyword Monitoring
Words like "send me tokens," "airdrop now," "claim," etc., are flagged.

#### ✅ Ban and Mute
Admins can blacklist abusive wallets. Users can mute individuals locally.

#### ✅ System Control
Tokens with extreme rug risk will auto-disable chat (read-only mode) to prevent further FOMO or fraud.
