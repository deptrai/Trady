# Message Types

There are multiple message types supported within the Chain Lens chat environment:

#### 🗣️ User Messages
These are messages typed and sent by users. They can include:
- Token opinions
- Entry calls
- Warnings
- General conversation and hype

All user messages are linked to the user's wallet and shown with a shortened address (e.g., 2kz4...eTY).

```
2kz4...eTY
```

#### 🔔 System Alerts
These are automated and triggered based on on-chain or platform-level events:
- Whale entered: "Wallet 9akd...Yw4 just bought 2.4 SOL of $FREN"
- Rug risk alert: "Token liquidity dropped by 80% in last 5m"
- Top wallet trade: "Leaderboard wallet Bkf5...3Ez just entered this token"
- Volume spike: "+120% swap volume in 15 minutes"

These alerts keep everyone informed without needing external tools.

#### 🤖 Bot Actions
Bots auto-delete spam, block known scam links, and rate-limit mass posting. Admins can issue bans (via wallet blacklist) and verify trusted wallets (via badge).
