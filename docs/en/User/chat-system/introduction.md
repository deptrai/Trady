# Introduction

DeFi is not just about data — it's about people reacting to data.

Markets move on emotion, rumors, narratives, and sudden waves of confidence or panic. While traditional platforms keep chat and trade separate, Chain Lens combines both into a seamless interface where users can:
- Trade tokens
- Copy smart wallets
- And talk — in real-time — with others doing the same

Chain Lens's Token Chat System is not a gimmick. It's a core part of the user experience, transforming isolated trades into a social, community-driven decision-making process.

Every token has its own chat. Every trade has context. Every wallet has a voice.
