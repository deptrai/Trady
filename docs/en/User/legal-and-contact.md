# Legal & Contact

Chain Lens is a decentralized software platform designed for self-custodial trading, analytics, and real-time interaction on the Solana blockchain. By using Chain Lens, you acknowledge that you are responsible for your actions, funds, and trading decisions.
The following section outlines our legal position, contact information, user responsibilities, and security policies.

**Chain Lens is not a custodian.**
We never hold user funds or access private keys. All wallets are generated, stored, and used directly within the user‚Äôs browser. Chain Lens has no backend access to any wallet, swap execution, or copy trade operation.

**There is no financial advice.**
All trading decisions made using Chain Lens‚Äôs interface ‚Äî including CopySwap, swap routing, wallet following, or token engagement ‚Äî are initiated by the user and not recommended by Chain Lens. We do not guarantee profits or endorse specific tokens or wallets.

**Risk Disclosure.**
DeFi and on-chain token trading involve high risk. Token values may fluctuate rapidly, and copying other wallets can result in loss. Users should understand the volatility of memecoins, rug risks, and the consequences of acting on unverified information ‚Äî including chatroom discussions.
Chain Lens does not offer investment guidance, and we encourage all users to do their own research (DYOR) before interacting with any on-chain asset.

**Data Privacy.**
Chain Lens does not collect or store any personal data. Wallets are anonymous unless a user chooses to share identifying information. Chat messages and interactions are tied only to wallet addresses.
No email, KYC, or login system is required.
We may analyze anonymized usage data (e.g. token trends, wallet activity patterns) to improve platform performance, but this data is never linked to personal identity.

**Security Responsibility.**
Your wallet is your responsibility. If you lose access to your private key and have not exported it, Chain Lens cannot help you recover funds. Always back up your wallet securely.
Never share your key with anyone, even if they claim to be support staff.

**Platform Liability.**
Chain Lens is an open frontend built on top of public Solana infrastructure. It does not control token contracts, DEX liquidity, or wallet behavior.
We are not responsible for user losses due to:
- Copying wallets that perform poorly
- Trading tokens that rug or lose liquidity
- Failing to export or back up wallets
- Following misleading information in chats

By using Chain Lens, you agree that you are operating at your own risk.

**Token Disclaimer.**
The $Chain Lens token (when launched) will be a utility token intended to enhance access to premium features and platform mechanics. It will not represent equity, dividends, or governance rights unless otherwise stated.
We will not conduct stealth launches or hidden airdrops. All official token updates will be announced publicly through our verified channels.

**No Partnerships Without Verification.**
Scammers often impersonate platforms to offer false integrations or IDO deals.
Chain Lens does not initiate partnerships via Telegram DMs or unverified tokens. Always confirm announcements via:
- ‚úÖ Twitter/X: @Chain LensProtocol
- ‚úÖ Telegram: t.me/Chain LensProtocol
- ‚úÖ Website: [https://chainlens.net](https://chainlens.net)

**Official Contact Channels**
- üì¨ General Inquiries: [email protected]
- üõ°Ô∏è Legal & Compliance: [email protected]
- üì¢ Community / Press: via X or Telegram

For support, feedback, or bug reports, users are encouraged to reach out directly via email or join the Telegram group to engage with the team.

**Jurisdiction & Compliance**
Chain Lens operates as an open-source, non-custodial protocol frontend and does not operate as a centralized financial service. Users are responsible for complying with local laws and regulations regarding cryptocurrency usage.
We do not serve restricted jurisdictions and will cooperate with legal authorities if required for security or abuse investigations, within reason and without compromising wallet anonymity.

**Closing Note**
Chain Lens was built with user freedom, privacy, and autonomy in mind. We strive to create tools that empower traders while reducing friction ‚Äî but ultimate responsibility always lies with you.
Please trade smart, stay safe, and never trust anyone who asks for your keys.
You are your wallet. You are your security.
