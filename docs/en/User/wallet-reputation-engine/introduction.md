# Introduction to Chain Lens's Wallet Reputation Engine

In a decentralized world, information is scattered and often unreliable — especially when it comes to judging the quality of a wallet.

Just because a wallet made a great trade yesterday doesn’t mean it's trustworthy or worth copying.

That’s where Chain Lens’s Wallet Reputation Engine comes in.

It’s an intelligent scoring system that continuously analyzes wallet behavior and assigns a trust score, helping users decide who to copy, who to avoid, and who’s actually performing consistently in a safe and transparent way.

This system is the heart of Chain Lens’s smart trading philosophy:
"Don’t just follow performance. Follow credibility."
