# Creating Your Chain Lens Wallet

When you click “Create Wallet,” Chain Lens securely generates a Solana wallet in your browser using `@solana/web3.js`.

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Self-custodial — your private key is never stored on our servers
- ✅ Encrypted & saved locally (in your browser)
- ✅ Exportable in Phantom-compatible JSON format
- ✅ Can be reset, locked, or imported anytime
- ✅ Session timeout available for added security

Chain Lens displays your private key only once, and strongly recommends exporting or saving it before proceeding.
