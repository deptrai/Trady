# Using CopySwap

Chain Lens’s signature feature: CopySwap allows you to mirror the trades of top-performing wallets in real-time.

#### How to use CopySwap:
1. Go to the Copy section
2. Browse top wallets (sorted by ROI & reputation)
3. Click “Start Copying”
4. Customize:
    - Max SOL per trade
    - Optional delay (e.g., 5 seconds)
    - Wallet filter options (e.g., only copy buys)

Chain Lens will now monitor that wallet. When they trade, you’ll automatically trade too.
