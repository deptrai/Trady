# Tracking Wallets & Performance

Before copying a wallet, you can analyze its performance and behavior via Chain Lensâ€™s Wallet Reputation Engine.

#### What you can see:
- ROI (7d, 30d, all-time)
- Total number of swaps
- Copy count (how many users are copying)
- Rug risk alerts
- Swap frequency and holding time behavior

This helps you identify consistently profitable wallets vs. short-term pumps.
