#### ðŸ”¹ What is Chain Lens?
Chain Lens is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Solana blockchain, combining real-time copy trading, in-browser wallet creation, intelligent reputation systems, and live token chat â€” all within a single, fast, and social-first platform.
Chain Lens eliminates friction and complexity for everyday crypto users by offering the full DEX experience without requiring any browser extension, wallet installation, or external setup. It allows users to:
- Instantly create a wallet in-browser
- Swap any Solana token at the best available price
- Copy trades from top-performing wallets with one click
- Track and analyze wallets using reputation scores
- Chat with other users live, in token-specific chat rooms
Itâ€™s not just another aggregator. Itâ€™s a new way to trade.
