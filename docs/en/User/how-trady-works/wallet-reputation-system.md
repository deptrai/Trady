# Wallet Reputation System

To prevent scams and bad trades, Chain Lens includes a dynamic Wallet Reputation Engine.

**Reputation Score Includes:**
- ROI (last 30d, 7d, all-time)
- Rug history detection (tokens dumped or pulled)
- Swap timing precision (buying before pumps)
- Copy count & trust signals (how many users are copying)
- Behavioral analysis: token rotation frequency, hold time

Wallets with high risk behavior are flagged with visible warnings and cannot appear on the leaderboard.
