# What Gets Copied?

Chain Lens currently copies the following swap details:
- Token A and Token B (input/output)
- Trade direction (buy/sell)
- Swap route (auto-optimized)
- Amount (based on your wallet and limit setting)
- Slippage settings (default or user-defined)

It does not copy:
- Wallet-to-wallet transfers
- NFT mints or transfers
- LP staking or farm interactions
- Any contract calls outside of direct swaps

CopySwap is focused strictly on token swaps â€” the most transparent and signal-rich actions in DeFi.
