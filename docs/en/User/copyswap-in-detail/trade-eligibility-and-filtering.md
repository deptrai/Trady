# Trade Eligibility and Filtering

Not all trades are automatically copied. Chain Lens allows you to customize how you follow wallets, ensuring full control over your risk and exposure.

Here are the filtering options available:
- Maximum Trade Amount: You can set a cap per copied trade (e.g., no more than 0.4 SOL).
- Copy Delay: Set a delay (e.g., copy trades 3 seconds after the original). Useful to avoid frontrunning or copy traps.
- Token Whitelist / Blacklist: Only copy trades involving certain tokens, or exclude tokens you donâ€™t want to hold.
- Buy/Sell Filters: Choose to copy only buys, only sells, or both.
- Minimum Liquidity Threshold (coming soon): Avoid copying trades on illiquid or recently launched tokens.

These features ensure that even while copying, you stay in control.
