# Risks & Protection

As with any copy trading system, there are risks — and Chain Lens includes several protections:

#### ✅ Wallet Reputation Score
Every wallet has a risk score based on past performance, token quality, rug activity, and more. High-risk wallets are labeled clearly and can be hidden.

#### ✅ Manual Stop
You can stop copying any wallet instantly — no need to wait for a trade cycle to end.

#### ✅ Trade Preview (Coming Soon)
Future versions will allow previewing incoming trades before execution for added control.

#### ✅ Community Reports
Flagged wallets (via community or system triggers) will be automatically demoted or suspended from copy visibility.
