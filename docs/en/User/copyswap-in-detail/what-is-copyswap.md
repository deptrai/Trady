# What is CopySwap?

CopySwap is one of the core innovations of Chain Lens. It brings real-time, automated copy trading to Solana in the simplest way possible.

With one click, users can begin mirroring the exact trades of top-performing wallets — fully automated, directly from their browser.

There’s no need to install bots, run scripts, or monitor charts. You just find a wallet with a high ROI and activate CopySwap. From there, Chain Lens will automatically replicate all of that wallet's eligible swaps in your wallet, according to your preferences.

It's like trading by delegation — you pick the brain, and Chain Lens handles the execution.
