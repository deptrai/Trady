# Wallet Safety Tips for Users

Even though Chain Lens is non-custodial, users should still practice basic crypto hygiene:
- 🔐 Always export your wallet when created
- 💾 Store your private key in a secure, offline location
- ❌ Never share your key — especially in chat or "support" DMs
- 🔒 Lock your session when stepping away from the device
- 🧹 Use reset if you believe your session may be compromised
- 📲 Don't trade on public Wi-Fi or shared computers without caution
