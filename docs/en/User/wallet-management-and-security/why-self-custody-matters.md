# Why Self-Custody Matters

At Chain Lens, we believe every user should control their own assets — not a platform, not a server, and definitely not a centralized wallet.

That's why we built Chain Lens with self-custodial wallets at its core.

Unlike traditional platforms where you must "connect" your Phantom or import a private key, Chain Lens lets you create, manage, export, and reset your Solana wallet directly in your browser — with zero backend custody.

Chain Lens gives you all the power of Phantom, with none of the friction.
