# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need Phantom or another wallet extension to use Chain Lens?**
No. Chain Lens allows you to create a self-custodial wallet directly in your browser without any extensions. It's a one-click setup — no installations or seed phrases required at the start. You can export the wallet and use it in Phantom later if desired.

**Is Chain Lens limited to the Solana blockchain?**
Yes, currently. Chain Lens is built entirely on Solana, utilizing Solana-native tools for swaps, wallet generation, and real-time data. Cross-chain expansion is under consideration for future releases.

**What exactly is Chain Lens? A wallet? A DEX? A trading tool?**
Chain Lens is all of those. It’s a decentralized trading platform that includes an in-browser wallet, an advanced swap interface (powered by Jupiter), real-time copy trading (CopySwap), a smart reputation system, and live token chat. Think of it as a fusion of Telegram, Phantom, and Jupiter — with a social layer added.

**How is my wallet stored? Is it secure?**
When you create a wallet, it is generated using Solana's native keypair system and stored encrypted in your browser’s local storage. It never touches a backend server. Only you have access to the private key. You can export and back it up anytime.

**What happens if I close my browser or clear data?**
If you haven’t exported your wallet, clearing cache or closing incognito windows may result in permanent loss of access. Always export your key and store it safely offline. Chain Lens offers both plain text and JSON export formats compatible with Phantom.

**Can I use my Chain Lens wallet in Phantom or vice versa?**
Yes. You can import your Chain Lens wallet into Phantom using the exported private key. Conversely, importing Phantom-created wallets into Chain Lens will be supported in future updates.

**How does CopySwap work in simple terms?**
You choose a wallet that’s performing well, click “Start Copying,” and every time that wallet makes a trade, your wallet mirrors it. Trades are executed via your funds, with your settings (max SOL, delay, etc.). You can stop copying any time.

**Is it risky to copy wallets?**
Copying carries risk — just like any trading strategy. However, Chain Lens helps reduce this risk by showing you each wallet’s reputation score, trade history, ROI, rug involvement, and more. Avoid wallets marked as High-Risk unless you’re comfortable with aggressive volatility.

**Can I copy multiple wallets at once?**
Absolutely. Chain Lens supports multi-wallet copying. Each copied wallet can have its own settings, and trades will run independently. You can stop copying one wallet without affecting the others.

**Can other people copy me? Do I earn from that?**
Yes. If you consistently perform well, others may begin copying your wallet. With the Copy2Earn system (rolling out in future versions), you’ll earn a small share of the copy fee, turning your trading strategy into a source of passive income and on-chain reputation.

**Does Chain Lens charge any fees right now?**
No. Currently, all features — swaps, wallet creation, copying, and chat — are free to use. Only Solana gas fees apply. Chain Lens plans to introduce platform fees in later phases, but $Chain Lens token holders will receive discounts or exemptions.

**What’s the purpose of the $Chain Lens token?**
$Chain Lens is the native utility token for the platform. It will unlock premium tools (like advanced copy filters, whale radar, faster alerts), offer fee reductions, boost visibility for high-scoring wallets, and grant early access to new modules. It’s also tied into the platform’s revenue sharing and burn mechanisms.

**Is $Chain Lens live? Where can I buy it?**
Not yet. The token will launch only after the platform reaches usage milestones and has a clear value foundation. The launch won’t be stealth or via pump.fun. Follow Chain Lens on X and Telegram for announcements.

**Can I use Chain Lens on mobile?**
Yes. Chain Lens is fully optimized for mobile browsers. All features — from wallet generation to chat — work seamlessly on Chrome, Safari, and other mobile browsers. A native mobile app is under consideration for the future.

**Is there a way to report bugs or suggest improvements?**
Yes. Users can provide feedback directly via:
- Twitter/X: @Chain LensProtocol
- Email: support@chainlens.net 
- Telegram: [t.me/Chain LensProtocol](https://t.me/Chain LensProtocol)

The team actively monitors all channels and encourages early users to shape the roadmap.

**Will Chain Lens expand to Ethereum or other chains?**
The current focus is Solana, where speed and low fees allow for real-time interaction. However, multi-chain copy trading is on the roadmap, including ETH and Base in later versions.

**Can I lose funds using Chain Lens?**
As with any DeFi platform, yes — if you copy a bad wallet, trade volatile tokens, or expose your private key. But Chain Lens minimizes risk with:
- Wallet reputation scores
- Rug detection heuristics
- Local-only key storage
- Full control over your wallet

If you follow best practices and use reputation data wisely, you significantly reduce your exposure.

**Is there a community I can join?**
Yes. Chain Lens has active communities on:
- Twitter/X: @Chain LensProtocol
- Discord (coming soon)
- Telegram: [t.me/Chain LensProtocol](https://t.me/Chain LensProtocol)

These are great places to share calls, learn from others, and help shape the platform.

**How does Chain Lens make money in the future?**
Chain Lens will generate revenue through:
- CopySwap micro-fees
- Premium tool access
- Leaderboard visibility boosts
- Strategic partnerships
- Token-based deflation (buybacks & burns)

Importantly, fees will never be extractive. They will fund development, reward token holders, and improve the ecosystem.

**Final Thoughts?**
Chain Lens was built to make DeFi simpler, faster, and smarter. Whether you’re new to crypto or deep into Solana already, Chain Lens lets you trade, copy, and explore without friction.
No wallet required. No account. Just you, the network — and the smartest traders, one click away.
