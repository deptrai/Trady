# $Chain Lens Token Utility

$Chain Lens is not just a governance token or speculative asset. It is the key to unlocking premium experiences on the platform.

#### Utility Breakdown:
- Staking for Access: Unlock premium features (Copy2Earn boost, radar filters, verified badge)
- Fee Discounts: Reduce or waive copy trade fees based on amount held
- Exclusive Features: Early access to beta tools, new modules, and cross-chain expansion
- Reputation Enhancement: Boost wallet trust score and listing priority when holding $Chain Lens (anti-Sybil mechanism)
- Buyback & Burn: A portion of all fees are used to buy and burn $Chain Lens from the market
- Partner Incentives: Launchpad partner tools may require holding $Chain Lens to access dev features

The token is core to the platform's economics â€” but never a barrier to entry.

Users can freely use the platform in its default mode. $Chain Lens just makes it better, faster, and smarter.
