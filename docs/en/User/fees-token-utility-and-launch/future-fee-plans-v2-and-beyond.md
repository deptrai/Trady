# Future Fee Plans (V2 & Beyond)

In future versions, Chain Lens will introduce a dynamic fee model tied to usage volume, wallet score, and $Chain Lens token holdings.

Here's what's planned:

#### ðŸ“Œ CopySwap Fee (1â€“3%)
- A small fee will apply to each mirrored swap
- Paid in SOL from the copied wallet's trade
- 50% of the fee will be burned or added to $Chain Lens buyback pool
- 50% may be directed to wallets being copied (Copy2Earn reward)

#### ðŸ“Œ Radar Access Fee
- Premium access to advanced radar filters, snipe tools, and whale signals may require staking or holding $Chain Lens

#### ðŸ“Œ Leaderboard Promotion
- Top wallets may pay a small $Chain Lens fee to be featured or verified

#### ðŸ“Œ Custom Copy Features
- Advanced features like multi-wallet copying, segmented strategy routing, or auto-sell on trigger may be part of a premium tier

The goal isn't to lock users out â€” it's to reward holders and scale the platform responsibly.
