# Current Fee Structure (V1)

As of V1 (initial public release), Chain Lens charges 0% platform fees for:
- Token swaps (via Jupiter routing)
- Wallet creation and export
- CopySwap activation and execution
- Chat access
- Token radar and reputation views

Users pay only standard Solana network gas fees, which are negligible (usually under $0.01 per action).

This approach is designed to:
- Encourage onboarding
- Maximize early adoption
- Remove financial friction for testing and exploration
- Build real usage data before introducing monetization layers

ðŸ’¡ Chain Lens is not free forever â€” it's free for now, to reward early users.
