# Introduction

One of the core philosophies behind Chain Lens is accessibility without compromise. That means building a product that offers powerful features while keeping barriers to entry low â€” including financial ones.

During the early stages, Chain Lens operates with zero platform fees. This enables users to explore and adopt features like CopySwap, wallet creation, and trend analysis without worrying about losing value to fees.

However, as the ecosystem matures and grows in usage, fees will be introduced in a way that adds value to $Chain Lens token holders, not punishes users.

This section explains the current and future fee structure, the role of the $Chain Lens token, and how the platform's launch is structured to protect both accessibility and sustainability.
