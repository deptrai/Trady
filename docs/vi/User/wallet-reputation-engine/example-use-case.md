# Example Use Case of Chain Lens's Wallet Reputation System

Imagine two wallets:
- Wallet A: Made 100% ROI in 3 days by aping two memecoins. Then disappeared.
- Wallet B: Makes 15â€“20% ROI weekly by rotating into new projects and stable trades. Maintains consistent history, no rugs, and 60+ copiers.

On most platforms, Wallet A would look more attractive.

But on Chain Lens, Wallet B is clearly labeled ðŸŸ¢ Trusted â€” and Wallet A is tagged ðŸŸ  Caution or even ðŸ”´ Risky depending on other signals.

The result? Safer decisions, more sustainable copy trading, and fewer pump-chasers getting wrecked.
