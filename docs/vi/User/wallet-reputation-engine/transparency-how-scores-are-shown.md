# Transparency: How Scores Are Shown

Each wallet has a detailed profile including:
- Current score and tier badge
- ROI graph (7d/30d/All-time)
- Last 10 swaps with outcomes
- Rug interaction log (if any)
- Number of current copiers
- Community flags or endorsements (coming soon)

This data helps users quickly evaluate a walletâ€™s quality without needing to go on-chain or consult external tools.
