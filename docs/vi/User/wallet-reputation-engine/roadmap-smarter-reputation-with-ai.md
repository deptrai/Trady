# Roadmap: Smarter Reputation with AI

While Chain Lens already uses behavioral heuristics, future versions will incorporate machine learning to detect:
- Trade clusters (e.g., wallet groups coordinating on a token)
- Hidden trends in copy performance
- Real-time anomaly detection (e.g., a wallet's strategy suddenly changes)

There will also be community scoring layers — where verified users can rate wallets, flag scams, or endorse good performers. These ratings will be reflected in the final score as "social trust weight."

### Summary

The Wallet Reputation Engine is what transforms Chain Lens from a copy-trading gimmick into a serious trading platform.

By combining performance data with behavioral risk metrics, it creates a trust layer for the copy trading economy — one where users can evaluate, rank, and follow wallets based on actual consistency, not just momentary luck.

In DeFi, performance is temporary.
But reputation, when tracked intelligently, is everything.
