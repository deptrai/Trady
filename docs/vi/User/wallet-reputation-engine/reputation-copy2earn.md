# Reputation + Copy2Earn

Reputation scores are also tied to Copy2Earn eligibility.

Only wallets with a score above 70 can qualify for:
- Boosted leaderboard placement
- Fee rewards per copier
- Optional featured visibility in "Top Wallets" section

This keeps the incentive system clean â€” only those who trade responsibly get rewarded, reducing risk for everyone else.
