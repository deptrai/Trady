# Why Wallet Scoring Matters

Copy trading is powerful — but only if you're following the right people. In most trading platforms, reputation is based solely on P&L (profit and loss). But short-term wins can be deceiving.

Some wallets might:
- Farm engagement by aping risky low-liquidity tokens
- Get lucky on one pump and disappear
- Frequently dump tokens they were “pushing”
- Trade in cycles that end up wrecking copiers

Chain Lens solves this by combining quantitative analysis with behavioral insights to deliver a dynamic score that reflects not just ROI — but risk, rhythm, and responsibility.
